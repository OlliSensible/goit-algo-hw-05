## Conclusion

- **Boyer-Moore is faster than KMP and Rabin-Karp:** In the benchmark results, Boyer-Moore showed better performance compared to both KMP and Rabin-Karp algorithms.

- **KMP is faster than Rabin-Karp:** The measurements indicate that the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm exceeds the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

- **Real search is faster than fake:** Across all three algorithms, the searches for real patterns were faster than searches for fake patterns.
